:four_leaf_clover: â€‹**CLOVER**  closed-loop visuomotor control framework that incorporates feedback mechanisms to improve adaptive robotic control:

- We introduce CLOVER, a generalizable closed-loop visuomotor control framework that incorporates a feedback mechanism to improve adaptive robotic control.
- We investigate the state-measuring attribute for latent embeddings and propose a policy by quantifying feedback errors explicitly. The error quantification settles the construction of an execution pipeline to resolve the challenge of handling uncertainties in video generation and task horizons.
- Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world robots verify the effectiveness of CLOVER. It surpasses prior state-of-the-arts by a notable margin (+8%) on CALVIN. The average length of completed tasks on real-world long-horizon manipulation improves by 91%.
